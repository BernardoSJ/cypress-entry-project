# Cypress Entry Project

This repository is my first practice project using **Cypress** as an automation tool.  
It focuses on automating tests for the demo application: [OrangeHRM Demo](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com).

## Running the Project

To run the tests locally:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Install dependencies (only the first time):
   ```bash
   npm install
